The game of reaching a milestone is entirely dependent on chance. It is
played between two players on a gameboard with numbered, gridded squares. On
the board, several random "danger zones" are depicted, each connecting two
distinct board squares. The goal of the game is to navigate from the start (bottom
square) to the finish (top square) using die rolls and the resulting number to help
or hinder by crossing the Danger zones of one's game piece.
